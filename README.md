### App Description
kittyluv is cat dating website mock-up. This website is for designing purposes and outlines a basic page flow. There is a navbar at top,
a hero image banner, a testimonials section, and a pricing section. The color scheme was also chosen by myself and I stuck to "softer" red tones 
with easy to read font. There is no interactivity beyond the nav bar.
